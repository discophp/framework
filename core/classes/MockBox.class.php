/**
 *  This little class helps empower our Router. 
 *  Esentially it only does one thing by default without extension.
 *  It will always return itself from methods calls it doesn't actually have.
 *  WTF? Why would we need to do this? When we are dealing with large method chains 
 *  and some action happens in which we want to purge an object, prevent instantiation of an object or generally
 *  let the method chain fail gracefully this really comes in handy. Instead of returning $this from the method in 
 *  the chain we can return a MockBox that was only ever instantiated once, thus preventing extenuous Class 
 *  instantiation and speeding up your application. 
 *
 *  Trust us, we're from the Internet.
